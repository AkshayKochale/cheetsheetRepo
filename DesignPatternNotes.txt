Design patterns are an essential part of software development. They provide reusable solutions to common problems that arise during the design and implementation of software systems. By following established design patterns, developers can improve code quality, enhance maintainability, and promote scalability.

Design patterns are like blueprints for structuring code. They encapsulate best practices and proven techniques that have been refined over time by experienced software engineers. By using design patterns, developers can leverage the collective wisdom of the software development community and avoid reinventing the wheel.

One of the key benefits of design patterns is that they promote code reusability. By abstracting common design problems into generic solutions, design patterns make it easier to apply and adapt these solutions across different projects. This saves time and effort and reduces the chances of introducing errors.

Design patterns also enhance code maintainability. By following a well-known design pattern, developers can create code that is easier to understand and modify. Design patterns provide a common language and structure, making it easier for developers to collaborate and maintain codebases over time.

Another advantage of design patterns is that they promote flexibility and extensibility. By decoupling different parts of a system and defining clear interfaces, design patterns allow for easier modification and extension without impacting the entire codebase. This makes systems more adaptable to changing requirements and reduces the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.

However, it's important to note that design patterns should not be applied blindly. They are not a silver bullet for all design problems and should be used judiciously. Each design pattern has its own strengths, weaknesses, and specific use cases. It's important for developers to understand the problem at hand and choose the appropriate design pattern that best addresses that problem.

In conclusion, design patterns are an invaluable tool for software developers. They provide reusable solutions to common design problems, enhance code quality and maintainability, and promote flexibility and scalability. By incorporating design patterns into their development practices, developers can create robust and well-structured software systems.



Design patterns can be categorized into three main types based on their purpose and scope: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns.

1. Creational Patterns:
   Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, providing ways to create objects in a manner that enhances flexibility and reusability.

  

2. Structural Patterns:
   Structural patterns focus on the composition of classes and objects, helping to define relationships between them and enabling them to work together effectively.

  
3. Behavioral Patterns:
   Behavioral patterns focus on the interaction and communication between objects, defining how they collaborate to achieve specific behaviors.

  
These are just a few examples of design patterns within each category. There are many more design patterns available, each serving a specific purpose in software design. It's important to understand their intent, benefits, and appropriate use cases to apply them effectively.







1)creational patterns


1. Singleton Pattern:
   - Example: Logger implementation in a software application.
   - Steps to create:
     1. Create a private static instance variable of the class.
     2. Make the constructor private to prevent direct instantiation.
     3. Provide a public static method (e.g., getInstance()) to access the instance.
     4. Use lazy initialization with double-checked locking to ensure thread safety.
     5. Use the instance wherever needed in the application.

2. Factory Pattern:
   - Example: A pizza restaurant that offers different types of pizzas.
   - Steps to create:
     1. Define an interface or abstract class (e.g., Pizza) that represents the common behavior of products.
     2. Create concrete classes (e.g., CheesePizza, PepperoniPizza) that implement the interface or extend the abstract class.
     3. Create a factory class (e.g., PizzaFactory) with a method (e.g., createPizza()) that takes a parameter (e.g., pizzaType) and returns an instance of the appropriate concrete class based on the parameter value.
     4. Use the factory class to create instances of the desired objects (e.g., PizzaFactory.createPizza("cheese")).

3. Builder Pattern:
   - Example: Creating a complex object like a computer with various components.
   - Steps to create:
     1. Create a builder class (e.g., ComputerBuilder) that has setter methods for each component of the complex object.
     2. The builder class should also have a method (e.g., build()) that constructs and returns the final object based on the provided components.
      3. Use the builder class to set the desired components and invoke the build method to obtain the fully constructed object (e.g., Computer computer = new ComputerBuilder().setCPU("Intel").setRAM(8GB).build()).

4. Prototype Pattern:
   - Example: Creating multiple similar objects based on an existing object, such as cloning a predefined configuration.
   - Steps to create:
     1. Implement the Cloneable interface in the class you want to make cloneable.
     2. Override the clone() method to provide a deep or shallow copy of the object.
     3. Use the clone() method to create new instances by cloning the existing object (e.g., newConfig = existingConfig.clone()).

5. Abstract Factory Pattern:
   - Example: An application that supports different themes (e.g., light theme, dark theme) with multiple related components (e.g., buttons, panels).
   - Steps to create:
     1. Define an interface or abstract class for each product family (e.g., Button, Panel).
     2. Create concrete classes for each product family (e.g., LightButton, DarkButton, LightPanel, DarkPanel).
     3. Create an abstract factory class (e.g., ThemeFactory) that declares abstract methods for each product.
     4. Implement concrete factory classes (e.g., LightThemeFactory, DarkThemeFactory) that instantiate and return the appropriate concrete product classes.
     5. Use the abstract factory to create families of related products (e.g., ThemeFactory factory = new LightThemeFactory(); Button button = factory.createButton();).





-------------------------------------------CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERNS --------------------------------------------------



								-----SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERN-----



The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures that only one instance of a class is created throughout the lifetime of an application. It is useful when you need to have a single point of access to a shared resource or when you want to restrict the instantiation of a class to a single object.

Here's an example of implementing the Singleton design pattern in Java:

java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
    private Singleton() {
    }

    // Method to get the instance of the Singleton class
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Other methods and variables can be added here
}


In this example, the Singleton class has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation from outside the class. It also declares a private static variable instance of type Singleton, which will hold the single instance of the class.

The getInstance() method is used to access the instance of the Singleton class. It follows a double-checked locking mechanism to ensure thread-safety. When the method is called, it first checks if the instance variable is null. If it is null, it acquires a lock on the class object using the synchronized keyword. Then, it checks again if the instance is still null inside the synchronized block to avoid multiple thread instances being created. If it is null, it creates a new instance of the Singleton class. Finally, it returns the instance variable.

Here's an example of how you can use the Singleton class:

java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Singleton singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        // Check if both references point to the same instance
        System.out.println(singleton1 == singleton2);  // Output: true
    }
}


In this example, singleton1 and singleton2 are two references obtained by calling the getInstance() method on the Singleton class. The == operator compares if the references point to the same instance, and in this case, it should return true.

By using the Singleton pattern, you ensure that there is only one instance of the Singleton class throughout the application, and all the references to that class point to the same object.



===========================================================================================================================================================


				-------------OBJECT POOL PATTERN------------------



Certainly! Here's a step-by-step summary of the Object Pool pattern, including the implementation steps, as well as a real-time example:

Object Pool Pattern:
1. Identify the objects that are expensive to create or require complex initialization.
2. Create an object pool class to manage the pooled objects.
3. Initialize the object pool by creating a fixed number of objects and adding them to the pool.
4. Implement logic to manage the availability of objects in the pool.
5. Provide methods to acquire and release objects from the pool.
6. Optionally, handle object expiration and removal from the pool.
7. Consider resetting the object state or using cloning to avoid carrying over modifications made by previous clients.

Implementation Steps:
1. Define the object pool class with two collections: one to hold available objects and another for used objects.
2. Initialize the object pool by creating objects and adding them to the available objects collection.
3. Implement the acquireObject() method to retrieve an available object from the pool.
4. Implement the releaseObject() method to release an object back to the pool.
5. Optionally, define a mechanism to reset the object state or use cloning to maintain object integrity.
6. Handle object expiration and removal from the pool if required.

Real-Time Example:
One real-time example where the Object Pool pattern can be applied is in database connection management. Establishing a database connection can be an expensive operation, especially in a multi-threaded environment where multiple clients require database access simultaneously. Instead of creating a new connection every time, an object pool can be used to manage a set of pre-initialized database connections.

When a client needs a database connection, it can acquire one from the pool, perform database operations, and release it back to the pool once done. This way, the costly process of creating and initializing database connections is minimized, and the system can efficiently reuse existing connections.

The Object Pool pattern can significantly improve the performance and resource management in scenarios where object creation or initialization is expensive, such as network connections, database connections, thread pools, or any other resource-intensive objects.



===========================================================================================================================================================

								-----------PROTOTYPE DESIGN PATTERN---------------------




The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones, avoiding the need for explicit construction. It is useful when the creation of an object is complex or costly, and you want to create new instances by copying an existing object.

Here are the steps to implement the Prototype design pattern in Java:

1. Design the Prototype interface: Create an interface or an abstract class that declares the cloning method. This method will be implemented by concrete prototype classes to perform the cloning.

2. Implement the Concrete Prototype classes: Create concrete classes that implement the Prototype interface. These classes should define their specific cloning logic by creating a new instance of themselves and copying the values of their attributes.

3. Create a PrototypeRegistry (optional): If you want to manage a registry of available prototypes, you can create a PrototypeRegistry class to store and retrieve them. This registry can be used to clone and create new instances based on the stored prototypes.

4. Client code: The client code requests a prototype from the PrototypeRegistry (if used) or directly from a Concrete Prototype. The client then clones the prototype to create new instances.

Now, let's illustrate the Prototype design pattern with an example:

java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

// Step 1: Prototype interface
interface Shape extends Cloneable {
    void draw();

    Shape clone();
}

// Step 2: Concrete prototype classes
class Circle implements Shape {
    private String color;

    public Circle(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle with color: " + color);
    }

    public Shape clone() {
        return new Circle(this.color);
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private String color;

    public Rectangle(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a rectangle with color: " + color);
    }

    public Shape clone() {
        return new Rectangle(this.color);
    }
}

// Step 3: PrototypeRegistry (optional)
class PrototypeRegistry {
    private Map<String, Shape> prototypes;

    public PrototypeRegistry() {
        prototypes = new HashMap<>();
        prototypes.put("Blue Circle", new Circle("blue"));
        prototypes.put("Red Rectangle", new Rectangle("red"));
    }

    public void addPrototype(String key, Shape prototype) {
        prototypes.put(key, prototype);
    }

    public Shape getPrototype(String key) {
        return prototypes.get(key).clone();
    }
}

// Step 4: Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Using PrototypeRegistry
        PrototypeRegistry registry = new PrototypeRegistry();
        Shape blueCircle = registry.getPrototype("Blue Circle");
        blueCircle.draw();

        Shape redRectangle = registry.getPrototype("Red Rectangle");
        redRectangle.draw();

        // Without PrototypeRegistry
        Circle customCircle = new Circle("green");
        Circle clonedCircle = (Circle) customCircle.clone();
        clonedCircle.draw();
    }
}


In this example, we have a Shape interface representing the prototype. Two concrete classes, Circle and Rectangle, implement the Shape interface and define their specific cloning logic in the clone() method.

We also have an optional PrototypeRegistry class that acts as a repository of prototypes. It allows clients to retrieve and clone prototypes based on keys. In the client code, we demonstrate using both the PrototypeRegistry and direct cloning of prototypes.

The Prototype design pattern provides a way to create new instances by copying existing objects, eliminating the need for explicit construction. It is particularly useful when object creation is complex or resource-intensive, and you want to avoid the overhead of creating new objects from scratch.



===========================================================================================================================================================

			-----------------------------BUILDER DESIGN PATTERN------------------------------------


The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. The Builder pattern is useful when you need to create objects with various configurations or when the construction process involves multiple steps or optional parameters.

Here are the steps to create the Builder design pattern in Java:

1. Define the Product: Create a class that represents the complex object you want to build. This class should have attributes and methods that define the object's properties and behavior.

2. Create the Builder: Create a separate class, called the Builder, that provides methods for setting each attribute of the product. Each method should return the Builder instance to support method chaining.

3. Implement the Builder: In the Builder class, implement the methods for setting each attribute of the product. These methods should update the corresponding attribute and return the Builder instance.

4. Add a build() method: In the Builder class, add a build() method that creates and returns the final constructed object. This method should use the collected attributes to instantiate the Product class.

Now, let's illustrate the Builder design pattern with an example:

java
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;
    // Other attributes and methods...

    private Car(Builder builder) {
        this.make = builder.make;
        this.model = builder.model;
        this.year = builder.year;
        this.color = builder.color;
        // Set other attributes...
    }

    // Getters...

    public static class Builder {
        private String make;
        private String model;
        private int year;
        private String color;
        // Other attributes...

        public Builder setMake(String make) {
            this.make = make;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setModel(String model) {
            this.model = model;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setYear(int year) {
            this.year = year;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setColor(String color) {
            this.color = color;
            return this;
        }

        // Setters for other attributes...

        public Car build() {
            return new Car(this);
        }
    }
}

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car.Builder()
                .setMake("Toyota")
                .setModel("Camry")
                .setYear(2022)
                .setColor("Blue")
                .build();

        // Use the constructed car object...
    }
}


In this example, we have a Car class representing the complex object we want to build. It has attributes like make, model, year, and color. The Car class has a private constructor that takes a Builder object and uses its attributes to construct the Car instance.

The Car class also has a static nested class called Builder, which provides methods for setting each attribute of the Car. Each method returns the Builder instance to enable method chaining. The Builder class collects the attribute values and provides a build() method that creates and returns the final Car object.

In the client code, we use the Builder to construct a Car object by chaining the setter methods and then calling the build() method to create the Car instance.

The Builder design pattern allows you to create complex objects step by step while providing flexibility in configuring the object's attributes. It promotes readable and maintainable code by separating the construction logic from the object's implementation.


===========================================================================================================================================================

									---------------------FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN ------------------


The Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates the object creation logic within a separate factory class, allowing clients to create objects by calling a common factory method. The Factory pattern is useful when you want to delegate the responsibility of object creation to a separate class, providing a single point of control for creating objects.

Here are the steps to create the Factory design pattern in Java:

1. Define the Product interface: Create an interface or an abstract class that represents the common interface for all the products that can be created by the factory. This interface defines the operations that the products can perform.

2. Implement the Concrete Products: Create concrete classes that implement the Product interface. These classes represent the different types of objects that the factory can create.

3. Create the Factory class: Create a factory class that encapsulates the object creation logic. This class typically contains a factory method that takes in parameters and returns an instance of the Product interface.

4. Implement the factory method: In the factory class, implement the factory method. This method uses the provided parameters to determine the specific type of product to create. It then constructs and returns an instance of the corresponding concrete product class.

Now, let's illustrate the Factory design pattern with an example:

java
// Step 1: Product interface
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void stop();
}

// Step 2: Concrete Products
class Car implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car stopped");
    }
}

class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle started");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle stopped");
    }
}

// Step 3: Factory class
class VehicleFactory {
    public Vehicle createVehicle(String type) {
        if (type.equals("Car")) {
            return new Car();
        } else if (type.equals("Motorcycle")) {
            return new Motorcycle();
        }
        return null;
    }
}

// Step 4: Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VehicleFactory factory = new VehicleFactory();

        Vehicle car = factory.createVehicle("Car");
        car.start();
        car.stop();

        Vehicle motorcycle = factory.createVehicle("Motorcycle");
        motorcycle.start();
        motorcycle.stop();
    }
}


In this example, we have a Vehicle interface representing the product. Two concrete classes, Car and Motorcycle, implement the Vehicle interface and define their specific start and stop behaviors.

The VehicleFactory class is the factory class that encapsulates the object creation logic. It contains the createVehicle() method, which takes a parameter specifying the type of vehicle to create. Based on the provided type, the factory method constructs and returns an instance of the corresponding concrete product class.

In the client code, we create an instance of the VehicleFactory and use it to create instances of Car and Motorcycle. By calling the start() and stop() methods on the created objects, we can see the specific behavior of each product.

The Factory design pattern provides a way to encapsulate object creation logic, allowing clients to create objects without specifying their concrete classes. It promotes loose coupling between the client code and the concrete classes, providing flexibility and extensibility in the creation process.


===================================================================================================================================================


								---------------ABSTRACT FACTORY PATTERN----------------

The Abstract Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates a group of factory methods, each responsible for creating a different type of product within the family. The Abstract Factory pattern is useful when you want to ensure that a set of related objects is created together or when you need to create objects that are designed to work together.

Here are the steps to create the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java:

1. Define the Abstract Factory: Create an abstract class or interface that declares a set of factory methods. Each factory method should return a different type of product interface representing a family of related objects.

2. Implement the Concrete Factories: Create concrete factory classes that implement the Abstract Factory interface. Each concrete factory is responsible for creating a specific family of products.

3. Define the Abstract Products: Create an abstract class or interface for each type of product that can be created by the factories. These abstract product interfaces represent the common interface for the products within each family.

4. Implement the Concrete Products: Create concrete classes that implement the abstract product interfaces. Each concrete product represents a specific variation of the product within its family.







============================================================================================================================================================

									------------STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN -------------------

					----------ADAPTER DESIGN PATTERN--------------


The Adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It converts the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect. This pattern is useful when you have two classes with incompatible interfaces and you want to make them work together without modifying their source code.

Here's an example to illustrate the Adapter design pattern:

Let's say we have an existing WeatherService interface that provides weather information in a certain format:

java
public interface WeatherService {
    public double getTemperature();
    public double getHumidity();
}


Now, we have a new client class called WeatherApp that expects weather information in a different format:

java
public class WeatherApp {
    public void displayWeather(double temperature, double humidity) {
        System.out.println("Temperature: " + temperature + "°C");
        System.out.println("Humidity: " + humidity + "%");
    }
}


We want to reuse the existing WeatherService implementation but make it compatible with the WeatherApp class. Here's where the Adapter pattern comes in.

First, we define a new interface, WeatherAdapter, that matches the expected interface of the WeatherApp class:

java
public interface WeatherAdapter {
    public double getTemperature();
    public double getHumidity();
}


Next, we create an adapter class called WeatherServiceAdapter that implements the WeatherAdapter interface and wraps the existing WeatherService implementation:

java
public class WeatherServiceAdapter implements WeatherAdapter {
    private WeatherService weatherService;

    public WeatherServiceAdapter(WeatherService weatherService) {
        this.weatherService = weatherService;
    }

    public double getTemperature() {
        // Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
        double fahrenheit = weatherService.getTemperature();
        return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
    }

    public double getHumidity() {
        // Convert humidity from percentage to decimal
        double humidityPercentage = weatherService.getHumidity();
        return humidityPercentage / 100;
    }
}


Now, we can use the WeatherServiceAdapter to make the existing WeatherService compatible with the WeatherApp class:

java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeatherService weatherService = new ThirdPartyWeatherService(); // Existing implementation
        WeatherAdapter adapter = new WeatherServiceAdapter(weatherService);

        WeatherApp weatherApp = new WeatherApp();
        weatherApp.displayWeather(adapter.getTemperature(), adapter.getHumidity());
    }
}


In this example, the WeatherServiceAdapter acts as a bridge between the WeatherService and the WeatherApp. It adapts the interface of the WeatherService to match the expected interface of the WeatherApp, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

The Adapter pattern helps achieve compatibility and reusability by allowing classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate effectively.


============================================================================================================================================

								----------------------BRIDGE DESIGN PATTERN-------------------------


The Bridge design pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from its implementation. It allows the abstraction and implementation to vary independently, enabling both to be modified or extended without affecting each other. The Bridge pattern promotes loose coupling between the abstraction and its implementation.

Here's an example to illustrate the Bridge design pattern:

Let's consider a scenario where we have different types of shapes (e.g., circles and squares) and different rendering engines (e.g., vector-based and raster-based) to render these shapes.

First, we define the shape abstraction, which represents the high-level abstraction of a shape:

java
public abstract class Shape {
    protected Renderer renderer;

    public Shape(Renderer renderer) {
        this.renderer = renderer;
    }

    public abstract void draw();
}


Next, we define the concrete shape implementations that extend the Shape abstraction:

java
public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(double radius, Renderer renderer) {
        super(renderer);
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
        renderer.renderCircle(radius);
    }
}

public class Square extends Shape {
    private double sideLength;

    public Square(double sideLength, Renderer renderer) {
        super(renderer);
        this.sideLength = sideLength;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Square");
        renderer.renderSquare(sideLength);
    }
}


Now, we define the renderer abstraction, which represents the high-level abstraction of a rendering engine:

java
public interface Renderer {
    void renderCircle(double radius);
    void renderSquare(double sideLength);
}


We can have multiple implementations of the Renderer interface. For this example, let's consider two implementations: VectorRenderer and RasterRenderer:

java
public class VectorRenderer implements Renderer {
    public void renderCircle(double radius) {
        System.out.println("Rendering Circle in Vector");
    }

    public void renderSquare(double sideLength) {
        System.out.println("Rendering Square in Vector");
    }
}

public class RasterRenderer implements Renderer {
    public void renderCircle(double radius) {
        System.out.println("Rendering Circle in Raster");
    }

    public void renderSquare(double sideLength) {
        System.out.println("Rendering Square in Raster");
    }
}


Now, we can create instances of shapes with different renderers:

java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Renderer vectorRenderer = new VectorRenderer();
        Renderer rasterRenderer = new RasterRenderer();

        Shape circle = new Circle(5, vectorRenderer);
        Shape square = new Square(10, rasterRenderer);

        circle.draw();
        square.draw();
    }
}


In this example, the Bridge pattern allows the shape abstractions (Circle and Square) to vary independently from the rendering engines (VectorRenderer and RasterRenderer). The Shape abstraction and the Renderer implementation are connected through the bridge, enabling different combinations of shapes and renderers.

The Bridge pattern helps in separating abstractions and implementations, allowing them to evolve independently. It promotes flexibility, extensibility, and easier maintenance of code by avoiding a rigid coupling between abstraction and implementation.


The Bridge design pattern is called "Bridge" because it acts as a bridge between two components: the abstraction and its implementation. It establishes a connection between these two components, allowing them to work together while keeping them separate and independent.

The pattern forms a bridge between the abstraction (high-level interface or class) and the implementation (low-level details or classes) by encapsulating each one in separate hierarchies. The abstraction and implementation hierarchies can then evolve independently without affecting each other, much like two separate sides of a bridge.


==================================================================================================================================================================
		
					--------------------------COMPOSITE DESIGN PATTERN-------------------------


The Composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures and work with both individual objects and groups of objects uniformly. It provides a way to treat individual objects and collections of objects in a uniform manner.

To understand the Composite pattern, let's consider an example of a hierarchical structure of an organization, which includes departments and employees. Each department can have sub-departments, and each department and sub-department can have employees.

First, we define a common component interface, which represents both individual objects and groups of objects:

java
public interface EmployeeComponent {
    void displayInformation();
}


Next, we create two concrete classes: Employee represents an individual employee, and Department represents a department that can contain employees and sub-departments.

java
public class Employee implements EmployeeComponent {
    private String name;
    private String position;

    public Employee(String name, String position) {
        this.name = name;
        this.position = position;
    }

    public void displayInformation() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Position: " + position);
    }
}

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Department implements EmployeeComponent {
    private String name;
    private List<EmployeeComponent> employees;

    public Department(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        employees = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addEmployee(EmployeeComponent employee) {
        employees.add(employee);
    }

    public void removeEmployee(EmployeeComponent employee) {
        employees.remove(employee);
    }

    public void displayInformation() {
        System.out.println("Department: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employees: ");
        for (EmployeeComponent employee : employees) {
            employee.displayInformation();
        }
    }
}


Now, let's create a main class to demonstrate the usage of the Composite pattern:

java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EmployeeComponent john = new Employee("John", "Manager");
        EmployeeComponent mary = new Employee("Mary", "Developer");
        EmployeeComponent peter = new Employee("Peter", "Developer");

        Department development = new Department("Development");
        development.addEmployee(mary);
        development.addEmployee(peter);

        Department marketing = new Department("Marketing");
        marketing.addEmployee(new Employee("Alice", "Marketing Manager"));
        marketing.addEmployee(new Employee("Bob", "Marketing Assistant"));

        Department company = new Department("Company");
        company.addEmployee(john);
        company.addEmployee(development);
        company.addEmployee(marketing);

        company.displayInformation();
    }
}


In this example, we create a hierarchy of objects using the Composite pattern. The Employee class represents individual employees, and the Department class represents departments that can contain both employees and sub-departments.

By treating both individual employees and departments as EmployeeComponent objects, we can operate on them uniformly through the displayInformation() method. This allows us to iterate over all the objects in the hierarchy and display their information recursively.

The Composite pattern simplifies the client code by providing a unified interface for both individual objects and groups of objects. It enables clients to treat complex structures as a single object, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.


=========================================================================================================================================================================

		--------------------DECORATOR DESIGN PATTERN-------------------------


The Decorator design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It provides an alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

To illustrate the Decorator pattern, let's consider an example of a coffee shop that offers different types of coffees with various additional ingredients.

First, we define an interface representing the base Coffee:

java
public interface Coffee {
    double getCost();
    String getDescription();
}


Next, we implement a concrete coffee class:

java
public class SimpleCoffee implements Coffee {
    public double getCost() {
        return 1.0; // Base cost of simple coffee
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return "Simple Coffee"; // Description of simple coffee
    }
}


Now, let's create a decorator class that adds an ingredient to the coffee:

java
public abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected Coffee decoratedCoffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee decoratedCoffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = decoratedCoffee;
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost();
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return decoratedCoffee.getDescription();
    }
}


We can then create concrete decorator classes that add specific ingredients to the coffee:

java
public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee decoratedCoffee) {
        super(decoratedCoffee);
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 0.5; // Additional cost for milk
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Milk"; // Additional description for milk
    }
}

public class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee decoratedCoffee) {
        super(decoratedCoffee);
    }

    public double getCost() {
        return super.getCost() + 0.2; // Additional cost for sugar
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return super.getDescription() + ", Sugar"; // Additional description for sugar
    }
}


Now, let's see how we can use the Decorator pattern to create different combinations of coffees with various ingredients:

java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee simpleCoffee = new SimpleCoffee();
        System.out.println("Cost: " + simpleCoffee.getCost() + ", Description: " + simpleCoffee.getDescription());

        Coffee milkCoffee = new MilkDecorator(simpleCoffee);
        System.out.println("Cost: " + milkCoffee.getCost() + ", Description: " + milkCoffee.getDescription());

        Coffee sugarMilkCoffee = new SugarDecorator(milkCoffee);
        System.out.println("Cost: " + sugarMilkCoffee.getCost() + ", Description: " + sugarMilkCoffee.getDescription());
    }
}


In this example, we start with a simple coffee and then dynamically add milk and sugar as decorators. Each decorator adds its own cost and modifies the description accordingly.

The Decorator pattern allows us to extend the behavior of individual objects without the need for creating multiple subclasses. It promotes flexibility and code reusability by providing a way to add and remove responsibilities dynamically.


====================================================================================================================================================================

						--------------------FACADE DESIGN PATTERN-------------------------


The Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system or set of classes. It encapsulates a group of classes and provides a unified interface, making it easier to use and understand.

To illustrate the Facade pattern, let's consider an example of a home theater system that consists of multiple components such as DVD player, projector, screen, and audio system.

First, we define the Facade class, which serves as a simplified interface to the home theater system:

java
public class HomeTheaterFacade {
    private DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;
    private Projector projector;
    private Screen screen;
    private AudioSystem audioSystem;

    public HomeTheaterFacade() {
        this.dvdPlayer = new DVDPlayer();
        this.projector = new Projector();
        this.screen = new Screen();
        this.audioSystem = new AudioSystem();
    }

    public void watchMovie(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Get ready to watch a movie...");
        dvdPlayer.on();
        dvdPlayer.insertDisc(movie);
        projector.on();
        projector.setInput(dvdPlayer);
        projector.setScreen(screen);
        projector.project();
        audioSystem.on();
        audioSystem.setSource(dvdPlayer);
        audioSystem.setVolume(50);
        audioSystem.play();
    }

    public void endMovie() {
        System.out.println("Shutting down the home theater...");
        dvdPlayer.off();
        projector.off();
        audioSystem.off();
    }
}


Next, we create the individual components of the home theater system:

java
public class DVDPlayer {
    public void on() {
        System.out.println("DVD player is on");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("DVD player is off");
    }

    public void insertDisc(String movie) {
        System.out.println("Inserting disc: " + movie);
    }
}

public class Projector {
    private DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;
    private Screen screen;

    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Projector is on");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Projector is off");
    }

    public void setInput(DVDPlayer dvdPlayer) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvdPlayer;
        System.out.println("Setting projector input to DVD player");
    }

    public void setScreen(Screen screen) {
        this.screen = screen;
        System.out.println("Setting projector screen");
    }

    public void project() {
        System.out.println("Projecting on the screen");
    }
}

public class Screen {
    public void up() {
        System.out.println("Screen is up");
    }

    public void down() {
        System.out.println("Screen is down");
    }
}

public class AudioSystem {
    private DVDPlayer dvdPlayer;

    public void on() {
        System.out.println("Audio system is on");
    }

    public void off() {
        System.out.println("Audio system is off");
    }

    public void setSource(DVDPlayer dvdPlayer) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvdPlayer;
        System.out.println("Setting audio system source to DVD player");
    }

    public void setVolume(int volume) {
        System.out.println("Setting volume to " + volume);
    }

    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Playing audio");
    }
}


Now, we can use the Facade class to simplify the usage of the home theater system:

java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HomeTheaterFacade homeTheater = new HomeTheaterFacade();
        homeTheater.watchMovie("Inception");
        System.out.println("------------------------");
        homeTheater.endMovie();
    }
}


In this example, the

 HomeTheaterFacade class acts as a simplified interface to the complex home theater system. It hides the complexity of the individual components (DVDPlayer, Projector, Screen, and AudioSystem) and provides a high-level interface to watch a movie and end the movie.

The Facade pattern simplifies the usage of complex systems by providing a convenient interface that encapsulates the underlying complexity. It improves code readability, maintainability, and reduces dependencies between clients and the system's components.


========================================================================================================================================================================

		-----------------------------FLYWEIGHT DESIGN PATTERN----------------------


The Flyweight design pattern is a structural design pattern that focuses on minimizing memory usage by sharing common data across multiple objects. It is used when there are a large number of similar objects, and the overhead of maintaining separate objects for each instance is significant.

To illustrate the Flyweight pattern, let's consider an example of a text editor where we have a large number of characters, and we want to minimize memory usage by reusing common characters.

First, we define the Flyweight interface, which represents the common properties and methods shared by multiple flyweight objects:

java
public interface Character {
    void draw();
}


Next, we create a concrete flyweight class that implements the Flyweight interface:

java
public class ConcreteCharacter implements Character {
    private char symbol;

    public ConcreteCharacter(char symbol) {
        this.symbol = symbol;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Character " + symbol + " is drawn.");
    }
}


Now, we create a factory class that manages the flyweight objects and ensures their proper creation and sharing:

java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CharacterFactory {
    private Map<Character, Character> characters = new HashMap<>();

    public Character getCharacter(char symbol) {
        Character character = characters.get(symbol);

        if (character == null) {
            character = new ConcreteCharacter(symbol);
            characters.put(symbol, character);
        }

        return character;
    }
}


Finally, let's use the flyweight objects in our text editor:

java
public class TextEditor {
    private CharacterFactory characterFactory = new CharacterFactory();
    private List<Character> characters = new ArrayList<>();

    public void insertCharacter(char symbol) {
        Character character = characterFactory.getCharacter(symbol);
        characters.add(character);
    }

    public void displayCharacters() {
        for (Character character : characters) {
            character.draw();
        }
    }
}


In this example, the CharacterFactory manages the flyweight objects and ensures that each unique character is created only once. When a new character is inserted in the text editor, the factory checks if it already exists. If it does, it returns the existing flyweight object; otherwise, it creates a new one and stores it in the factory for future use.

The TextEditor class uses the flyweight objects to insert and display characters. Instead of creating a new object for each character, it uses the flyweight objects retrieved from the factory, reducing memory usage by reusing shared objects.

The Flyweight pattern is beneficial when there are many similar objects with shared data, and memory usage needs to be optimized. It allows for the efficient use of resources by minimizing the number of objects created and promoting object sharing.

======================================================================================================================================================================

				---------------PROXY PATTERN-------------------

The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object in order to control its access or add extra functionality. It allows you to create a class that acts as an interface to another class, providing a level of indirection to the original object. In Java, you can implement the Proxy pattern using interfaces or inheritance.

Here's an example of implementing the Proxy pattern in Java using interfaces:

java
// Subject interface
public interface Image {
    void display();
}

// RealSubject class
public class RealImage implements Image {
    private String filename;

    public RealImage(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
        loadFromDisk();
    }

    private void loadFromDisk() {
        System.out.println("Loading image: " + filename);
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Displaying image: " + filename);
    }
}

// Proxy class
public class ImageProxy implements Image {
    private String filename;
    private RealImage realImage;

    public ImageProxy(String filename) {
        this.filename = filename;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        if (realImage == null) {
            realImage = new RealImage(filename);
        }
        realImage.display();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Image image = new ImageProxy("example.jpg");
        // Image is not loaded until display() is called
        image.display();
        // Image is already loaded, display() doesn't load it again
        image.display();
    }
}


In this example, the Image interface represents the subject, which is the common interface between the RealImage and ImageProxy classes. The RealImage class is the real object that represents an image and performs the actual loading and displaying of the image. The ImageProxy class acts as a proxy for the RealImage class, delaying the creation of the RealImage object until the display() method is called.

When the client code creates an ImageProxy object, the image is not loaded immediately. Only when the display() method is invoked, the ImageProxy checks if the RealImage object has been created. If not, it creates the RealImage object and delegates the display() method call to it. Otherwise, it simply calls the display() method on the existing RealImage object.

This pattern can be useful in scenarios where creating the real object is expensive, or when you need to control access to the real object or add additional behavior around it. The Proxy pattern allows you to achieve these goals without modifying the existing code of the real object.

==========================================================================================================================================================================


												------------------BEHAVIORAL DESIGN PATTERN -------------------


							--------------- CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY --------------


The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled or reaches the end of the chain. Each handler in the chain has the ability to handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.


Sure! Here's an example of how the Chain of Responsibility pattern can be applied to process a payment through a bank, credit card, and PayPal:

java
// The base handler interface
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void setNext(PaymentProcessor next);
    void processPayment(MoneyAmount amount);
}

// Concrete handler for Bank payment
public class BankPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentProcessor next;

    @Override
    public void setNext(PaymentProcessor next) {
        this.next = next;
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment(MoneyAmount amount) {
        if (amount.getCurrency().equals("USD")) {
            System.out.println("Processing payment through Bank...");
            // Perform Bank-specific payment processing logic here
        } else if (next != null) {
            next.processPayment(amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("No payment processor found for the currency.");
        }
    }
}

// Concrete handler for Credit Card payment
public class CreditCardPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentProcessor next;

    @Override
    public void setNext(PaymentProcessor next) {
        this.next = next;
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment(MoneyAmount amount) {
        if (amount.getCurrency().equals("USD") || amount.getCurrency().equals("EUR")) {
            System.out.println("Processing payment through Credit Card...");
            // Perform Credit Card-specific payment processing logic here
        } else if (next != null) {
            next.processPayment(amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("No payment processor found for the currency.");
        }
    }
}

// Concrete handler for PayPal payment
public class PayPalPaymentProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    private PaymentProcessor next;

    @Override
    public void setNext(PaymentProcessor next) {
        this.next = next;
    }

    @Override
    public void processPayment(MoneyAmount amount) {
        if (amount.getCurrency().equals("USD") || amount.getCurrency().equals("EUR") || amount.getCurrency().equals("GBP")) {
            System.out.println("Processing payment through PayPal...");
            // Perform PayPal-specific payment processing logic here
        } else if (next != null) {
            next.processPayment(amount);
        } else {
            System.out.println("No payment processor found for the currency.");
        }
    }
}

// Money amount class
public class MoneyAmount {
    private double amount;
    private String currency;

    public MoneyAmount(double amount, String currency) {
        this.amount = amount;
        this.currency = currency;
    }

    public double getAmount() {
        return amount;
    }

    public String getCurrency() {
        return currency;
    }
}

// Usage example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create the chain of payment processors
        PaymentProcessor bankProcessor = new BankPaymentProcessor();
        PaymentProcessor creditCardProcessor = new CreditCardPaymentProcessor();
        PaymentProcessor payPalProcessor = new PayPalPaymentProcessor();

        bankProcessor.setNext(creditCardProcessor);
        creditCardProcessor.setNext(payPalProcessor);

        // Create a payment
        MoneyAmount paymentAmount = new MoneyAmount(100.0, "USD");

        // Process the payment
        bankProcessor.processPayment(paymentAmount);
    }
}


In this example, we have three concrete payment processors: BankPaymentProcessor, CreditCardPaymentProcessor, and PayPalPaymentProcessor. Each processor implements the PaymentProcessor interface, which defines the setNext and processPayment methods. Each processor checks if it can handle the payment based on the currency. If it can handle the payment, it performs the necessary payment processing logic. If not,

 it passes the payment to the next processor in the chain. If there are no more processors in the chain, it outputs a message indicating that no payment processor was found for the currency.

In the Main class, we create a chain of payment processors by setting the next processor for each processor. Then, we create a payment with an amount of 100.0 USD and pass it to the first processor in the chain. The payment will be processed and handled by the appropriate processors in the chain, or an appropriate message will be displayed if no processor is found for the currency.

			    ------------------COMMAND DESIGN PATTERN -------------------------


The Command design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that decouples the sender of a request from the receiver of that request. It encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Here's an example of implementing the Command design pattern in Java:

java
// The Command interface
interface Command {
    void execute();
}

// The Receiver class
class Receiver {
    void performAction() {
        System.out.println("Action performed by the receiver");
    }
}

// Concrete command implementation
class ConcreteCommand implements Command {
    private Receiver receiver;

    ConcreteCommand(Receiver receiver) {
        this.receiver = receiver;
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
        receiver.performAction();
    }
}

// The Invoker class
class Invoker {
    private Command command;

    void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }

    void executeCommand() {
        command.execute();
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a receiver
        Receiver receiver = new Receiver();

        // Create a concrete command and associate it with the receiver
        Command command = new ConcreteCommand(receiver);

        // Create an invoker and set the command
        Invoker invoker = new Invoker();
        invoker.setCommand(command);

        // Execute the command
        invoker.executeCommand();
    }
}


In this example, we have a Command interface that declares the execute() method. The Receiver class defines the operations that can be performed. The ConcreteCommand class implements the Command interface and encapsulates a specific action to be performed on the Receiver. The Invoker class sets the command and invokes the execute() method.

When the Main class is executed, it creates a Receiver object, a ConcreteCommand object associated with the receiver, and an Invoker object that sets the command. Finally, the executeCommand() method is called on the Invoker, which in turn calls the execute() method on the associated command, resulting in the action being performed by the receiver.

This demonstrates how the Command design pattern allows the sender of a request (Invoker) to be decoupled from the receiver (Receiver) by encapsulating the request as an object (Command).
